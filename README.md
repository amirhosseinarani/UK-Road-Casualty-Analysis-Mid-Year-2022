# UK Road Casualty Statistics Mid 2022 Exploration

## Introduction
This project aims to explore the mid-2022 statistics of road casualties in the UK, analyzing various aspects such as the severity of accidents, the impact on different demographics, and identifying potential areas for improvement in road safety.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset includes information on road accidents, vehicle details, and casualty information, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of the factors contributing to road accidents.

## Analysis Methods
We employed statistical analysis and machine learning models to understand the patterns in the data. Techniques include exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, clustering, and classification.

## Results
Our analysis revealed significant insights into the common causes of accidents, the distribution of accidents across different age groups and genders, and the identification of high-risk areas.

## Discussion and Conclusion
The findings suggest that certain behaviors and locations are more prone to accidents. Recommendations for reducing road accidents include implementing stricter traffic laws, enhancing road safety education, and improving infrastructure in high-risk areas.

## Recommendations
- Increase awareness and education on road safety.
- Implement targeted interventions in high-risk areas.
- Explore further with machine learning models to predict and prevent accidents.
